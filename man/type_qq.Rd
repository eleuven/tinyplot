\usage{
type_qq(distribution = qnorm, lty = NULL, col = "black", lwd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{distribution}{Distribution function to use.}

\item{lty}{line type. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to the
number of categories in the \code{by} variable. See \code{lty}. In addition, users
can supply a special \code{lty = "by"} convenience argument, in which case the
line type will automatically loop over the number groups. This automatic
looping will begin at the global line type value (i.e., \code{par("lty")}) and
recycle as necessary.}

\item{col}{plotting color. Character, integer, or vector of length equal to
the number of categories in the \code{by} variable. See \code{col}. Note that the
default behaviour in \code{tinyplot} is to vary group colors along any variables
declared in the \code{by} argument. Thus, specifying colors manually should not
be necessary unless users wish to override the automatic colors produced by
this grouping process. Typically, this would only be done if grouping
features are deferred to some other graphical parameter (i.e., passing the
"by" keyword to one of \code{pch}, \code{lty}, \code{lwd}, or \code{bg}; see below.)}

\item{lwd}{line width. Numeric scalar or vector of length equal to the
number of categories in the \code{by} variable. See \code{lwd}. In addition, users
can supply a special \code{lwd = "by"} convenience argument, in which case the
line width will automatically loop over the number of groups. This
automatic looping will be centered at the global line width value (i.e.,}
