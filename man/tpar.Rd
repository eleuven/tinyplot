\usage{
tpar(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{arguments of the form \code{key = value}. This includes all of the
parameters typically supported by \code{\link[graphics]{par}}, as well as
the \code{tinyplot}-specific ones described in the 'Graphical Parameters'
section below.}
}
\description{
\code{tpar} extends \code{\link[graphics]{par}}, allowing you to set
or query the standard group of graphical parameters (i.e., provided by the
latter function), as well as the additional graphical parameters provided
by \code{tinyplot}. Similar to \code{\link[graphics]{par}}, parameters are set
by passing appropriate \code{key = value} argument pairs. Multiple parameters
can be set or queried at the same time.

\section{Additional Graphical Parameters}{


\tabular{lll}{
\code{facet.cex} \tab\tab Expansion factor for facet titles. Defaults to \code{1}.\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{facet.font} \tab\tab An integer corresponding to the desired font face for facet titles. For most font families and graphics devices, one of four possible values: \code{1} (regular), \code{2} (bold), \code{3} (italic), or \code{4} (bold italic). Defaults to \code{NULL}, which is equivalent to \code{1} (i.e., regular).\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{facet.col} \tab\tab Character or integer specifying the facet text colour. If an integer, will correspond to the user's default global colour palette (see \code{\link[grDevices]{palette}}). Defaults to \code{NULL}, which is equivalent to "black".\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{facet.bg} \tab\tab Character or integer specifying the facet background colour. If an integer, will correspond to the user's default colour palette (see \code{\link[grDevices]{palette}}). Passed \code{\link[graphics]{rect}}. Defaults to \code{NULL} (none).\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{facet.border} \tab\tab Character or integer specifying the facet border colour. If an integer, will correspond to the users default colour palette (see \code{\link[grDevices]{palette}}). Passed \code{\link[graphics]{rect}}. Defaults to \code{NA} (none).\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{fmar} \tab\tab A numeric vector of form \code{c(b,l,t,r)} for controlling the (base) margin padding, in terms of lines, between the individual facets in a faceted plot. Defaults to \code{c(1,1,1,1)}, i.e. a single line of padding around each facet. If more that three facets are detected, the \code{fmar} parameter is scaled by 0.75 (i.e., three-quarters) to reduce the excess whitespace that would otherwise arise due to the absent axes lines and labels. (An exception is made for 2x2 plots to better match the \code{cex} expansion logic of the base graphics system under this particular layout.) Similarly, note that an extra 0.5 lines is subtracted from each side of the facet padding for plots that aren't framed, to reduce excess whitespace.\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{last_facet_par} \tab\tab Full list of graphical parameters used to constructed the most recent faceted \code{tinyplot} plot during the current session. Unlike other \code{tpar} parameters, this parameter is intended for internal use (specifically, to enable adding further elements on top of an existing faceted plot) and should \emph{not} be set by the user.\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\tab\tab\cr
\code{lmar} \tab\tab A numeric vector of form \code{c(inner, outer)} that gives the margin padding, in terms of lines, around the automatic \code{tinyplot} legend. Defaults to \code{c(1.0, 0.1)}, where the first number represents the "inner" margin between the legend and the plot region, and the second number represents the "outer" margin between the legend and edge of the graphics device. (Note that an exception for the definition of the "outer" legend margin occurs when the legend placement is \code{"top!"}, since the legend is placed above the plot region but below the main title. In such cases, the outer margin is relative to the existing gap between the title and the plot region, which is itself determined by \code{par("mar")[3]}.)\cr

\examples{
# Return a list of existing base and tinyplot graphic params
tpar("las", "pch", "facet.bg", "facet.cex")

# Simple facet plot with these default values
tinyplot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, facet = ~am, grid = TRUE)

# Set params to something new. Similar to graphics::par(), note that we save
# the existing values at the same time by assigning to an object.
op = tpar(las = 1, pch = 2, facet.bg = "grey90", facet.cex = 2)

# Re-plot with these new params
tinyplot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, facet = ~am, grid = TRUE)

# Reset back to original values
tpar(op)
