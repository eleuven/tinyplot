\title{tinyplot: Lightweight extension of the base R graphics system, with
support for automatic legends, facetting, and several other enhancements.}
\description{
The goal of \strong{tinyplot} is to provides a lightweight extension
of the base R graphics system with various convenience features,
particularly for representing groups with your data. For example, the core
\code{tinyplot()} function (alias: \code{plt()} with no vowels) makes it easy to plot
different categories of a dataset in a single function call and highlight
these categories (groups) using modern colour palettes. Coincident with
this grouping support, \code{tinyplot()} also produces automatic legends with
scope for further customization. While the package offers several other
enhancements like facets, it tries as far as possible to be a drop-in
replacement for the equivalent base plotting calls. Users should generally
be able to swap a valid \code{plot()} call with \code{tinyplot()} without any changes
to the expected output.
