#' @title tinyplot: Lightweight extension of the base R graphics system, with
#'   support for automatic legends, facetting, and several other enhancements.
#'
#' @description The goal of **tinyplot** is to provides a lightweight extension
#'   of the base R graphics system with various convenience features,
#'   particularly for representing groups with your data. For example, the core
#'   `tinyplot()` function (alias: `plt()` with no vowels) makes it easy to plot
#'   different categories of a dataset in a single function call and highlight
#'   these categories (groups) using modern colour palettes. Coincident with
#'   this grouping support, `tinyplot()` also produces automatic legends with
#'   scope for further customization. While the package offers several other
#'   enhancements like facets, it tries as far as possible to be a drop-in
#'   replacement for the equivalent base plotting calls. Users should generally
#'   be able to swap a valid `plot()` call with `tinyplot()` without any changes
#'   to the expected output.
